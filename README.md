# Overview
It's sometimes disgusting to search something in Google and then one-by-one visit the pages that come out there, if you don't get the 
satisfaction.
This project was an effort to solve this.
Search anything and no need to go back anywhere.
Get everything in a single page.

# Usage:
1. You would need a webserver package like Xampp
2. Just Start the Server
3. Visit localhost
4. Enjoy Searching
